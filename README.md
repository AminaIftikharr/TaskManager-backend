**Overview**
Welcome to the Task Manager API! This project serves as a robust backend solution for managing tasks, built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API provides a comprehensive set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing seamless interaction with a MongoDB database to handle all your task management needs.

**Features**
**Task Operations:** Perform essential CRUD operations on tasks, such as creating new tasks, retrieving task details, updating task information, and deleting tasks.
**User Authentication:** Secure your task data with user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access, modify, or delete their tasks.
**Database Integration:** Utilize MongoDB as the underlying database, providing a scalable and flexible storage solution for your task management application.
**Middleware:** Implement middleware functions to enhance functionality, such as handling authentication, logging, and error management.
**RESTful API:** Follow RESTful principles to design a clean and intuitive API, making it easy for frontend applications to integrate and interact with the backend.
